# ArcGIS Demo


## About
Work in progress as I explore the ArcGIS API for Javascript.


## Getting Started
To run this app, make sure you have Node.js on your computer.
Then simple run `http-server` in the home folder of this repository to start a local server. If you don't have http-server on your computer, run `npm install http-server -g` to install it.
